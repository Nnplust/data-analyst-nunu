# 🌟 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Internal Hiring Process

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the internal hiring process** of an academic department. The goal is to analyze and optimize **candidate selection and faculty hiring management ** using **ETL workflows and AWS cloud infrastructure**.

## 📊 System Architecture
Below is the **architecture diagram** representing the data processing workflow:

## 🛠️ ETL Workflow
The ETL process is structured as follows:

### **1️⃣ Candidate List - ETL Jobs**
- **Data Source:** Internal database
- **ETL Process:** Data extraction, transformation, and validation
- **Export to System & User**

## ☁️ AWS Cloud Setup
The system leverages **AWS services** for secure data handling:

- **AWS Beanstalk** - Hosting and managing application logs of the academic department
- **S3 Bucket** - Storing processed logs from ETL

**Workflow:**

- Raw data files ( Candidate, position, faculty list) are being summarized and stored into **S3 for archival and analytics**.
- Processed data is exported back to the **system & users** file in the S3 Bucket.
